# Pipelines

Pipeline is a computation expression used to combine `HttpHandlers` in a declarative manner.

The result of the computation expression is a standard Giraffe `HttpHandler` which means that it's easily composable with other parts of the Giraffe ecosystem.

**Example:**

*)

open Saturn

let headerPipe = pipeline {
    set_header "myCustomHeader" "abcd"
    set_header "myCustomHeader2" "zxcv"
}

let endpointPipe = pipeline {
    plug fetchSession
    plug head
    plug requestId
}
