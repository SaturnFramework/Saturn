Saturn is a web development framework written in F# which implements the server-side MVC pattern. Many of its components and concepts will seem familiar to anyone with experience in other web frameworks like Ruby on Rails or Pythonâ€™s Django.

It's heavily inspired by Elixir's [Phoenix](http://phoenixframework.org/).

## Documentation

Saturn has nice [documentation](https://saturnframework.org/explanations/overview.html) and I appreciate any help to improve it further by sending pull requests or just adding an issue with what you think is missing.

## How to build

1. Install the .NET 6.0 SDK from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/6.0
2. Restore dotnet SDK tools: `dotnet tool restore`
3. Inside the repo directory, run `dotnet run`

## How to run the automated tests for this project

Here we will present two ways of running the automated tests for this project. The first one is the preferred way since it is the same command used in the [CI build script](https://github.com/SaturnFramework/Saturn/blob/main/.github/workflows/build.yml#L23):

* Inside the repo directory, run `dotnet run -- Test`.

Although, there is this second approach where you can specify a test scenario to run filtering by its statement:

1. Change the directory to the tests folder using `cd tests/Saturn.UnitTests/`
2. List all the tests statements with this command: `dotnet run --list-tests`
3. Run only one test scenario, filtering by the test statement like in this example: `dotnet run --filter "Controller Routing Tests.Add works"`.

## How to contribute

*Imposter syndrome disclaimer*: I want your help. No really, I do.

There might be a little voice inside that tells you you're not ready; that you need to do one more tutorial, or learn another framework, or write a few more blog posts before you can help me with this project.

I assure you, that's not the case.

This project has some clear Contribution Guidelines and expectations that you can [read here](https://github.com/SaturnFramework/Saturn/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

The contribution guidelines outline the process that you'll need to follow to get a patch merged. By making expectations and process explicit, I hope it will make it easier for you to contribute.

And you don't just have to write code. You can help out by writing documentation, tests, or even by giving feedback about this work. (And yes, that includes giving feedback about the contribution guidelines.)

Thank you for contributing!
